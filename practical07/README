///////COMMENT ON THE HIGHER ORDER POLYNOMIALS ESTIMATES FETTING WORSE.////
The issue with higher-order polynomials ariese from the chracteristics of Taylor series expansiion for the exponential function e^x. As more terms are incorporated, the series converges at a slower rate, especially when dealing with the larger values of x.
In our case when we use polynomial f(x) to estimate e with x=1, we are calculating the taylor series expansion for e^1.
While the series exhibits satisfactory convergence for small x, augmenting the polynomial's order results in diminishing results. The terms x^n/n! becomes exceedingly smaller for larger n, causing the impact on higher order terms to wane rapidly. As a result, the estimation converges to a limit, and further escalation of the order does not significantly enhance accuracy.
